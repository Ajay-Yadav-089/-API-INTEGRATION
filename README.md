## Project Description
This project is a responsive webpage that fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap's free API and displays it in a user-friendly format. It was developed as part of an API integration learning journey using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The webpage dynamically loads weather data for a specified city and displays details such as temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.

The application uses OpenWeatherMap's Current Weather Data API, which provides comprehensive weather information for any city worldwide. The API key is free for personal use and allows up to 60 calls per minute, which is sufficient for this project.
